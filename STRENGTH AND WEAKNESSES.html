					<article><h2>Advantages</h2>

					<p>1.	Scalability and Efficiency: K-Means clustering is known for its scalability and efficiency. It has a linear time complexity, which means that it can handle large datasets conveniently. With unlabeled big data, K-Means offers many insights and benefits as an unsupervised clustering algorithm. It can also be used with parallel computing to speed up the process, making it a faster and more efficient algorithm.<br><br>
2.	Simplicity: One of the main advantages of K-Means clustering is its simplicity. It is relatively easy to implement and identify unknown groups of data from complex datasets. The results are presented in an easy and simple manner, which makes it easy to explain the results in contrast to Neural Networks. With K-Means clustering, you can quickly get insights into your data without the need for complex algorithms.<br><br>
3.	Flexibility: K-Means clustering is a flexible algorithm that can easily adjust to changes. If there are any problems, adjusting the cluster segment will allow changes to easily occur on the algorithm. This flexibility makes K-Means clustering an ideal choice for data segmentation and pattern recognition. It can also be used with different distance metrics and initialization methods, which makes it a versatile algorithm that can be used for a wide range of applications.

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

					<p>1.	Sensitivity to Initial Conditions: K-means is sensitive to initial conditions. The algorithm randomly initializes the cluster centroids at the beginning, and the final clustering results can vary depending on these initial positions. Different initializations can lead to other local optima, resulting in different clustering outcomes. This makes the K-means algorithm less reliable and reproducible.<br><br>
2.	Difficulty in Determining K: One of the drawbacks of the K-means algorithm is that we have to set the number of clusters (K) in advance. Choosing an incorrect number of clusters can lead to inaccurate results. Various methods are available to estimate the optimal K, such as the silhouette analysis or elbow method, but they may not always provide a clear-cut answer. If we use a too-small K, we’ll get too broad clusters. Conversely, an overlarge K results in clusters that are too specific. <br><br>
3.	Inability to Handle Categorical Data: Another drawback of the K-means algorithm is its inability to handle categorical data. The algorithm works with numerical data, where distances between data points can be calculated. However, categorical data doesn’t have a natural notion of distance or similarity. When categorical data is used with the K-means algorithm, it requires converting the categories into numerical values, such as using one-hot encoding. One shortcoming of using one-hot encoding is that it treats each feature independently and can degrade performance since it can significantly increase data dimensionality.<br><br>
4.	Time Complexity: The time complexity of the K-means algorithm is O(n  x K x D x M), where n is the number of data points, K is the number of clusters, D is the number of dimensions, and M is the number of iterations.
